# csci355 final project

In this project, you will create a web-based parser of literary texts that also reports on the word frequencies of the texts being parsed. The website must have a navigation bar, a form for users to request online books to be parsed, an optional start/end string for parsing, a page which displays all past results of books parsed by the user, and a portion of the website which provides networking information for the user's connection.

This should be deployed on the CS Dept server (Venus/Mars) or another publicly accessible server with free or paid hosting. (Running locally on your laptop/desktop doesn't suffice.) 

This project will require usage of MySQL, HTML, PHP, and CSS
